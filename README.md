# Infineuro Craft

A Chrome Extension, that connects the popular web game Infinite Craft with the Neuro SDK, which allows AI Twitch Streamer Neuro-Sama to play the game. The extension gives Neuro the knowledge over all available Items and the ability to craft two Items together.

This Project uses the Javascript implementation of the Neuro Game SDK by "AriesAlex". The Access to the Infinitecraft functions is based on the IC Autocrafter Script made by "Active Tutorial".

## Install

To Install the Infineuro Craft Extension you need to follow these steps:

1. Download this project (via git clone or as zip file)
2. Open the Chrome Extensions Page: chrome://extensions/
3. Activate Developer Mode in the upper right corner
4. Click "Load Unpacked" and choose the root folder of this Project
5. Open the extension and set the Neuro API URL
6. Open Infinite Craft and enjoy Neuro playing the game

If you get the Message "Websocket Error" then your API URL is probably not correct. More Information can be found in the Chrome Developer Console.

## Future Plans

- Better visual Representation of the crafting
- Upload the extension to the Chrome Web Store
- Firefox and Safari Support
- Give Neuro more available actions
